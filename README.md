## Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-Module
The goal of this module is to detect credit card fraudulent transactions using some of machine learning algorithms concepts, such as:

#### 1. Logistic regression 
#### 2. Decision trees 
#### 3. Neural network


This module contains several files:

1. Readme ~ It has a really detailed description of the whole module. The algorithms concepts, some clarifications regarding libraries and functions I have used. Also several images of plots and observations.
2. HTML file ~ This is like a guideline, the whole code, outputs and plots in the same folder.
3. RMD ~ It is necessary file as I have used RMarkdown to write and generate the dataset. So it shows the data modeling, manipulation, etc.
4. CSV file ~ Finally, the dataset itself. It is a little large around 150.8 MB. So I have splitted it to 10 csv files, all uploaded in this repo.


### Neural network final modeling in this repo should be like:
